description = """
In times of turmoil, unite. Rise beyond tribalism. Calling the Guardians of the Multichain.

As the world is starting to embrace crypto and it is becoming more apparent that a lot of economic activity is moving on-chain, we want to reinforce the notion of a multi-chain world.

As the leading interoperability platform for multichain bridges and applications, Wormhole embodies this sentiment to the fullest. This is why we want to facilitate a place for the Wormhole community and ecosystem partners to connect, exchange, and advocate the vision of a 'web of web3'.

Expect a full day of workshops, presentations, panels, as well as games, music, food and drinks.

Agenda coming soon. Please RSVP.
