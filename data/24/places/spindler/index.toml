description = '''
Located directly on the Spree, this works Spindler & Klatt as one of the most extraordinary locations in Berlin.
The focus is on reducing things to the essentials, with the highest standards of functionality and aesthetics always being in the foreground.

A microcosm in the capital, which has been home to a wide variety of event concepts on the former East-West border for 20 years.
The implementation of the Spindler & Klatts is based on the idea of a studio that can continue to develop technically and logistically over the years and stands for special ideas and concepts.

Typically Berlin - self-confident, diverse, creative and international
